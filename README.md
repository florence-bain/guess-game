# Guess Game #

A short numbers game!

This is a small project that I have created to practice using Ruby to help develop my skills.

The game is a maths trick that will guess (correctly) the total number you are left with after a number of actions.

I was motivated to include interaction with a user, to design a game where a user makes a choice.

The game is to be run on the command line.

Follow the instructions and have fun :)

Note* You only need to type your name when prompted, after this you only need to use "Enter".

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby guess-game.rb
```
